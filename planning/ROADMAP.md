# SCH Schedule Builder — Structural Analysis & Roadmap

## Change History

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 2026-09-11 | PNE20 (6A) unit zip ingested: 354 sch; CTSMonPro `CYCSA-P1107-S01-R001-N013` (first CYCSA-P1107 family vs PNE19 CYCN-P1107). Dominant `0x00010004/696` (343), 10×`0x10002/612`, no `0x10005/720`. Spec 5V/6.0A 3-range. Writer not verified. |
| 2026-09-11 | PNE18/PNE19 (both 6A) unit zips ingested. PNE18 shares PNE17 CTS `CYCC-1006-S01-R006-N04` but SCH corpus is **612-only** (53×0x10003, 4×0x10002). PNE19 is a new `CYCN-P1107-S01-8001-N03` family; dominant `0x00010004/696` (267), no `0x10005/720`. GUI Spec on PNE19 is 9.0A 3-range vs 6A recommended max. |
| 2026-09-11 | PNE17 (6A) CTSMonPro `CYCC-1006-S01-R006-N04` recorded (new 1006/R006 family vs PNE15/16). `c:\PNE17.zip` is empty (`PNE17/` only); no SCH layout observed. |
| 2026-09-11 | PNE16 (6A) unit zip ingested: 2453 sch; dominant `0x00010004/696` (matches goldens); also `0x00010005/720` (221). CTSMonPro `CYCC-1004-S01-R004-N01`. |
| 2026-09-11 | PNE15 (6A) unit zip ingested: dominant `0x00010004/696`; first `0x00010005` corpus (header 1868 / step 720). CTSMonPro build `CYCC-1004-S01-R004-N01`. Writer layout not verified on this unit. |
| 2026-08-31 | Initial draft: documented the structure based on `sch_file_structure_20250211.xlsx`, ASSB_Analyzer_dev, and the Ensol PNE converter; established the roadmap for a visual modular schedule builder |
| 2026-08-31 | Created the `pne_scheduler/` package — IR, C-rate, module stubs, CLI, and example `.schproj` |
| 2026-08-31 | Reassessed repository status — secured the original SCH archive and reprioritized implementation and validation |
| 2026-09-01 | Ensol sch_maker zip ingested; 612-byte mV/mA offset map adopted (`schema/ensol_v612.py`) |
| 2026-09-02 | Lab data policy: only `PNE##.zip` for cycler analysis; per-unit SCH layout + CTS build registry (`LAB_DATA_POLICY.md`, `EQUIPMENT_REGISTRY.json`) |
| 2026-09-02 | Project directory map + code rules: [`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) |
| 2026-09-02 | MD docs consolidated: [`planning/README.md`](README.md), [`LAB_CORPUS_REPORT.md`](LAB_CORPUS_REPORT.md), [`docs/README.md`](../docs/README.md), [`docs/GATE_B.md`](../docs/GATE_B.md) |
| 2026-09-03 | Gate C audit: C5 blocking; C6 reframed; lessons checklist + modular UX vision (§1, §5.6, §6.6) |
| 2026-09-03 | Clarified UX intent: Autolab Nova + LabVIEW **feel** for schedule/module authoring — not realtime instrument control |
| 2026-09-06 | Audited all step-field evidence against PNE02 controlled pairs and corpus mining; replaced the single-purpose C5 smoke fixture with one combinatorial `smoke_writer_probe` covering charge/discharge/LOOP/sampling so one reopen suffices (`GATE_C5_EVIDENCE_COVERAGE.md`) |
| 2026-09-06 | Fixed the open resume safety issue: LOOP goto targets are now remapped to post-splice step numbering (or resume is blocked with a clear error) instead of silently keeping stale original step numbers |
| 2026-09-06 | Code audit pass: `write_sch` no longer discards `compile_step_warnings()` (CLI `build` now prints/records DCR, `goto_step_id`, and the newly-added `end_capacity_fraction`/`fEndC` warnings), fixed a dead label-check in `insitu_cycle`, and fixed a dataclass-field type-resolution bug in `bulk_edit` that silently turned negative int params into floats |
| 2026-09-06 | Second audit pass (background agent + manual verification): fixed a Gate B5 evidence-integrity bug where a controlled pair's `expected_field` mismatch was only a warning, not an error, letting the wrong offset be counted as controlled-pair evidence; fixed an overly-permissive `_L_EXPLICIT` regex in `stack/levels.py` that mistook ordinary letter+digit filename fragments (e.g. "Cell01", "bimodal-30") for explicit L-level markers, confirmed against 2 real corpus fixtures |
| 2026-09-06 | Roadmap-process audit: discovered hosted CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, live since 2026-09-02) has been red for 12 consecutive commits despite ROADMAP claiming F6 "not started"; corrected §6.1/§6.7/L13. Corrected two now-false "scheduled for deletion" notes in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (`io/reader.py`, `validate/roundtrip.py` are both load-bearing). Synced `planning/README.md`'s index (10 missing files). Added `ruff` as a lint dev-dependency, wired into CI |
| 2026-09-06 | Pushed the fix (`d60ea3b`); hosted CI green again (run #33). Deleted 3 confirmed-dead code paths (2 tools scripts, 1 3.7MB vendor archive); README now shows a live GitHub Actions badge instead of a static count. Re-split Gate D/E/F by per-task equipment dependency (only C5, E3/E3.1, F1–F4 actually need a PNE PC) and unblocked the rest for parallel work per user authorization. Found 6 unmerged `cursor/*` branches from earlier Cursor Cloud runs — 3 touch UI (theming, module recipes, schedule explanation) and look salvageable as design reference, not junk; see §6.6.1 and `UI_UX_NOTES.md` |
| 2026-09-08 | **C5 passed on PNE02** (`smoke_writer_probe.sch`); Gate C exited with documented gaps (DCR IR-only; 696 tail unused; CLI `build_sch_header` 54-byte gap open). OCV/Impedance/Pattern/Balance IR+compiler stubs + offset registry (`STEP_TYPES_EXTENDED.md`); Gate D P0 harness started (`validate/gate_d_harness.py`) |
| 2026-09-08 | Gate D software slice completed: capacity contract tests; Formation/Rest/Cycle Life + RPT/DC-IR + HPPC/capacheck/QPEED/in-situ harness; golden family topology compares (`validate/topology.py`) |
| 2026-09-08 | Gate D verification method + audit remediations: `GATE_D_VERIFICATION.md`, harness charge-V/loop checks, `run_gate_d_verification` → `GATE_D_VALIDATION_REPORT.json` (`gate_d_passed=true`; current matrix 49 pass) |
| 2026-09-08 | Post-C5 status sweep (L5): cleared stale "behind C5" wording from the gate diagram, Gate E `Depends on`/Rules/E3/E3.1 rows, and Gate F F1–F4 — the C5 pass satisfied those dependencies. Added [`GUARDRAILS.md`](GUARDRAILS.md), a topic-grouped reading view of §5.6/§8/§11 |
| 2026-09-08 | Gate D mutation backtest found and fixed two verification holes (V6 never compared module expansions; skips did not block `gate_d_passed`) — see §11. Archived closed-gate evidence and consumed analysis outputs to [`../legacy/`](../legacy/README.md); only files with zero `.py` references were moved, and the C5 signed record stays cited from Gate F2 |
| 2026-09-08 | Gate E/pattern re-audit: added the missing module-composition contract (single final END, rebased LOOP references), separated imported patch sessions from authored projects, added pattern trust/catalog and desktop UX requirements, and established [`PATTERN_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](PATTERN_VALIDATION_PLAN.md). DOD@384 and module SOC cutoff (`fEndC@36`) now require separate controlled pairs before SOC-dependent pattern approval |
| 2026-09-09 | Gate E workspace shipped: one window (설정 → 프로토콜 → 절차 → 검증 → 내보내기) on a Qt/QML default shell with a Tk fallback, both driving a shell-free `ui/workspace_model.py`. Added `spec/` ParameterSpec, lenient `ir/loader.py`, `ir/procedure.py`, `ir/equipment_profile.py` (schproj v2), staged export gates in `release.py`, and Korean summaries in `report/`. CI now installs the `[gui]` extra so the default UI is actually exercised. E2.4/E3 → ✅ |
| 2026-09-09 | Gate E2.1/E2.3/E4 and F5 closed: primitive palette (fragment-local repeat instead of a bare LOOP), append-only method library keyed to equipment, byte-preserving `.sch` import session (2 bytes changed for one field edit; CTSPro header untouched), and release labels bound to a content hash so an approval cannot follow an edited file |
| 2026-09-09 | Web port boundary settled ahead of a Next.js UI: [`WEB_PORT_PLAN.md`](WEB_PORT_PLAN.md). Server stays on the lab PC, core API is stateless (the project is the document and undo is a client-side stack of snapshots), and the line is drawn at whether an operation touches equipment-facing bytes. Same audit corrected E2.3 and E4 from ✅ to 🔄 — both are model-complete but have no user-reachable path |
| 2026-09-09 | Web port promoted to **Gate G** (§6.8) with G0–G5 tasks, exit criteria and rules, rather than living in a side document outside the gate structure. G is parallel to F, not downstream of it. G0 absorbs what E2.3/E4 left unreachable |
| 2026-09-09 | **Gate G complete** (G0–G5): stateless-path unblocking that also closed E2.3/E4, a Flask API grouped as derive/transform/plan/local-resource, a Next.js workspace rendering forms from `spec/` metadata with undo and autosave in the browser, a gated export route, deletion of the Tk and Qt shells (4,058 lines), and a one-command lab-PC launcher. The safety model is tested across the browser path: a bad value still saves while every export gate closes |
| 2026-09-09 | Post-gate efficiency sweep, measurement-first: a 2000-cycle campaign showed 1294 validation rows saying six things, 1135 blockers on one gate, seven schedule expansions per request and an 800 KB response per keystroke. Findings are collapsed with counts, the procedure is memoised on project content, and the step table moved to its own route — **2.1× faster and 11.2× smaller**, expansions 7 → 1. Pinned by `tests/test_scaling.py` |

## 1. Goal

Enable creation of `.sch` binary schedule files for PNE cyclers **without using the native CTSEditorPro workflow as the primary authoring tool**.

### 1.1 Product vision (target UX)

**UI design inspiration (not a product clone):** schedule authoring should *feel* like building a method in **Autolab Nova** and wiring experiment blocks in **LabVIEW** — because that workflow already matches how battery schedules are composed from reusable modules.

What that means in practice:

| Feel we want | In this product |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Drop / place **modules** then tune parameters | Experiment modules (Formation, Cycle Life, RPT, HPPC, …) expand to steps |
| Ordered **procedure** of commands | Step list: CC, CCCV, Rest, Loop, END, … with a property pane |
| Library of reusable methods | Versioned `.schproj` / module templates |
| Clear cell / setup before editing | Explicit **Cell Profile** (1C = mA, limits, equipment) — never inferred for write |
| Check readiness before leaving the editor | Pre-export validation + manifest + release labels |

**Out of scope (clarified 2026-09-03):** realtime potentiostat-style instrument control, live I–V plots, CTSMonPro replacement. Export `.sch` → open/run on CTS remains the execution path. “Autolab” here is **visual/interaction language for making schedules**, nothing more.

Nova and LabVIEW are **co-equal metaphors** for the same idea: modular composition. Prefer a clean procedure + module palette first; a free-form campaign canvas can follow if needed.

### 1.2 Functional goals

- Users author **schedules from primitives + modules**, not raw binary fields
- Users enter a **C-rate**; current (mA) is calculated from an **explicit** reference capacity (1C = ___ mA)
- Generated `.sch` files must be **CTSPro-reopen-verified** (and later equipment-verified) before any “executable” label
- Dual authoring paths: **`patch-sch`** (template-preserving, preferred near-term) and experimental from-scratch **`build`**

---


## 2. `.sch` File Structure (Current Understanding)

### 2.1 Sources

| Source | Role | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| `schema/reference/sch_file_structure_20250211.xlsx` | Expected official PNE field definitions (by version) | Canonical reference; JSON export in same folder |
| `ASSB_Analyzer_dev` → `assb_analyzer/io/pne_converter.py` | Reading, validation, and metadata extraction | Optional external validator; not included in the repository |
| `_vendor/Ensol_PNE_framework/pne_app/io/pne_converter.py` | Partial reader for CycleNum and DCIR reference | Local vendor copy |
| `vendor/ensol_sch_maker_ref/` (`Ensol_sch_maker` zip) | **Working 612-byte writer/reader**, mV/mA offsets, rescaler, block expanders | Adopted → `schema/ensol_v612.py`, parser/compiler fixes; see `planning/ENSOL_SCH_MAKER_ADOPTION.md` |
| `assb_analyzer/io/cell_c_rate_reference.py` | C-rate ↔ capacity ↔ current (analysis side) | **Logic reusable by the writer** |
| `assb_analyzer/io/classification_bulk_apply.py` | Comparison of identical SCH structure fingerprints | Bulk application of compatible Source values |

> **Current implementation:** The standalone layout detector/viewer parser in `io/sch_parser.py`
> coexists with the ASSB/Ensol adapter in `io/reader.py`. `io/writer.py` is a spike
> that builds a full `0x00010003`/1760 header but must not yet be considered a
> PNE-compatible writer until Gate C2–C5 complete.
> The CLI blocks `build` by default unless the developer explicitly passes
> `--allow-experimental-output`; even acknowledged output is for offline analysis only.

### 2.2 File Versions (Excel Sheets)

| Sheet name | `nFileVersion` | Step field count (approx.) | Notes |
|------------|----------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Type1 `0x00010001` | 65537 | ~90 | Legacy, `szName[64]` |
| Type2 `0x00010001` | 65537 | ~90 | Similar to Type1 |
| `0x00010002` | 65538 | ~90 | |
| `0x00010003` | 65539 | ~105 | ASSB converter **default target** (`step_size=612`) |
| `0x00010004` | 65540 | ~118 | `step_size=696`, header 1844 |
| `0x00010005` | 65541 | prefix + unmapped +24B tail | **Observed PNE15 2026-09-11**: header 1868, `step_size=720`. Not in the 2025-02-11 Excel sheets. Shared 612-byte prefix only; not a writer target. |
| `0x00010007` | 65543 | **132** (includes `stEISSet`) | Latest, adds EIS fields |

**Primary target version:** `0x00010003` + `step_size=612`
→ The ASSB converter already implements its layout policy, DCIR SOC rules, and current-condition mapping for this combination.
**Secondary:** `0x00010004` + `step_size=696`, which accounts for 90% of the corpus.
**Observed, not a writer target:** `0x00010005` + `step_size=720` (PNE15/PNE16 unit zips). PNE18 (`CYCC-1006`) corpus is 612-only; PNE19 (`CYCN-P1107`) and PNE20 (`CYCSA-P1107`) are 696-dominant with no 720 — 6A tier does not imply 696 or 720.
**Later:** `0x00010007` (when EIS experiments are needed).

### 2.4 Step Type / Mode Codes

**chType (Step type)**

| Name | Code | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| CHARGE | 0x01 | Charge |
| DISCHARGE | 0x02 | Discharge |
| REST | 0x03 | Rest |
| OCV | 0x04 | OCV measurement |
| IMPEDANCE | 0x05 | Impedance |
| END | 0x06 | End |
| CYCLE | 0x07 | Cycle marker |
| LOOP | 0x08 | Loop |
| PATTERN | 0x09 | Pattern file |
| BALANCE | 0x0A | Balance |

**chMode (Execution mode)** — combinations used by the converter:

| Code | Meaning | Converter mapping |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 0x0101 | CCCV | `SCH_STEP_TYPE_CCCV` |
| 0x0201 | CC Charge | `SCH_STEP_TYPE_CC_CHARGE` |
| 0x0202 | CC Discharge | `SCH_STEP_TYPE_CC_DISCHARGE` |

**Relationship between SCH and CTS StepNo (important):**

```
CTS StepNo = SCH StepNo + 1
```

Both ASSB `cell_c_rate_reference.py` and `pne_converter.py` validate current conditions based on this mapping. The writer must follow the same rule.

### 2.5 Validated Layout Registry

| `nFileVersion` | Header / payload offset | Step record | Fixture count |
|----------------|-------------------------:|------------:|--------------:|
| `0x00010002` | 1632 | 612 | 6 |
| `0x00010003` | 1760 | 612 | 4 |
| `0x00010004` | 1844 | 696 | 92 |

Across the corpus of 102 files, versions and framing match these three combinations
exactly, with no footer. This is an invariant of the current sample; it does not assume
that unseen producers use the same structure. The writer must select the version-specific
schema through the layout registry and preserve unknown/reserved bytes.

The 696-byte record is not formed simply by appending 84 bytes to the 612-byte record.
Later fields are shifted by 8 bytes in comparable schedules, so a separate field map is required.

### 2.6 Core Step Fields (Required for Experiment Module Design)

These names describe the intended module contract, not a claim that every binary offset and
unit is verified. `schema/fields.py` is authoritative for current evidence confidence.

| Field | Intended meaning | Current evidence | Module input |
|-------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| `fVref` | Target voltage | Semantic unverified | Charge upper limit / discharge lower limit |
| `fIref` | Target current | Semantic unverified; equipment scaling unresolved | **C-rate × reference capacity** |
| `fEndTime` | End time | Semantic unverified | Rest or pulse interval |
| `fEndV` | End voltage | Corpus inferred | CC-CV transition or discharge termination |
| `fEndI` | End current | Corpus inferred | CV cutoff C-rate |
| `fEndC` | End capacity | Semantic unverified; no nonzero fixture | SOC setting or partial cycle |
| `fEndCVTime` | CV phase duration | Offset unresolved | CV duration |
| `loop_target/count` | Loop target and count | Corpus inferred at `+48/+52` | Cycle-life and RPT loops |
| `nGotoStepID` | SOC reference step | Offset/semantics unresolved | DC-IR SOC setting |
| `fDCRStartTime/EndTime` | DCIR measurement window | Offset/semantics unresolved | DC-IR module |
| `fDeltaTime/V/I` | Data sampling | Offset/semantics unresolved | Sampling profile |
| `fSocRate` | SOC ratio | Legacy offset only | SOC setting step |
| `fMaxCapacity` | Reference capacity | Legacy offset only | C-rate calculation basis |

## 3. Proposed Architecture

### 3.1 3-Layer Structure

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  UI Layer — Visual Flow Editor (LabVIEW style)           │
│  Node graph: drag-drop modules, wire connections         │
└────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┘
                         │ project JSON (.schproj)
┌────────────────────────▼─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Domain Layer — Experiment Modules + Schedule IR         │
│  Formation / CycleLife / RPT / HPPC / DCIR / Rest ...    │
│  C-rate Engine, Loop expander, Safety validator          │
└────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┘
                         │ compiled step list
┌────────────────────────▼─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Binary Layer — SCH Writer + Round-trip Validator        │
│  struct pack, version-aware offsets, PNE float32 rules   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Intermediate Representation (Schedule IR)

Place a **version-independent IR** between the UI and binary layers.

```python
@dataclass
class ScheduleProject:
    name: str
    cell_profile: CellProfile          # reference capacity, Vmax/Vmin
    sch_version: int                   # 0x00010003
    modules: list[ExperimentModule]    # graph nodes
    connections: list[ModuleConnection]  # execution order

@dataclass
class CellProfile:
    nominal_capacity_mAh: float
    v_max: float
    v_min: float
    # optional: formation capacity, DCIR pulse C-rate table

@dataclass
class StepIntent:
    # User-friendly intent — C-rate based
    step_type: Literal["charge","discharge","rest","ocv","cycle","loop","end"]
    mode: Literal["CCCV","CC","CV"]
    c_rate: float | None              # used to derive fIref
    cv_cutoff_c_rate: float | None    # used to derive fEndI
    end_voltage_v: float | None
    end_time_s: float | None
    end_capacity_fraction: float | None  # SOC 50% → fEndC
    ...
```

Modules generate `StepIntent[]`, and the compiler flattens it into `FILE_STEP_CONDITION` byte records.

### 3.3 C-rate Engine (Addresses Requirement 3)

```
I_mA = C_rate × Q_nominal_mAh
```

| Input | Example | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1C charge, 80 mAh cell | C=1.0 | I = 80 mA |
| C/3 discharge | C=0.333 | I = 26.7 mA |
| CV cutoff C/20 | C=0.05 | fEndI = 4 mA |

**UI rules:**
- The user-facing unit is **always C-rate** (direct current input is available only as an advanced option)
- Set `nominal_capacity_mAh` once in the Cell Profile → propagate it to every module
- Provide the allowed C-rate table (`_ALLOWED_CURRENT_RATES`) from ASSB `cell_c_rate_reference.py` as presets
- When writing output, apply PNE raw units (mA) and float32 packing (`_f32repr` rules)

### 3.4 Visual UI (Addresses Requirement 1)

**Screen layout:**

```
┌─────────────┬────────────────────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Module      │  Canvas (node graph)           │ Properties   │
│ Palette     │                                │ Panel        │
│             │  [Formation]──▶[CycleLife]     │              │
│ · Formation │         │                      │ C-rate: 1C   │
│ · CycleLife │         └──▶[RPT every 50]     │ Vmax: 4.2 V  │
│ · RPT       │                                │ Loop: 500    │
│ · HPPC      │                                │              │
│ · DC-IR     │                                │              │
│ · Rest      │                                │              │
│ · Loop      │                                │              │
└─────────────┴────────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘
│ Timeline preview  │  Step table  │  Export .sch  │  Validate │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Technology stack candidates:**

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **A. Tkinter + custom canvas** | Same stack as pne_studio2, simple deployment | Significant effort to implement the node graph |
| **B. PySide6 + NodeEditor** | Closer to the LabVIEW UX | Adds dependencies |
| **C. Web (React Flow) + Electron** | Best graph UX | Separate app, complex deployment |

**Recommendation:** Start the Phase 3 visual UI as a separate app in `pne_scheduler/ui/`, then integrate it with pne_studio2 later.

## 4. Experiment Module Catalog (Requirement 2)

### 4.1 Phase 1 — Essential Modules

| Module | Step pattern | Main parameters (C-rate based) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **Formation** | Charge CCCV → Rest → Discharge CC → Rest (×N cycles) | charge C, discharge C, Vmax/Vmin, cycle count |

| **RPT** | Reference discharge (C/3) → Rest → pseudo-OCV steps | C_ref, SOC checkpoints, anchor cycle interval |
| **DC-IR** | SOC setting discharge → Rest → pulse discharge (short CC) → Rest | SOC %, pulse C, pulse duration, DCR window |
| **HPPC** | SOC staircase + pulse train (charge/discharge pulses) | SOC list, pulse C, pulse/rest duration |
| **Rest / OCV** | Rest or OCV hold | duration, ΔV sampling |

    def validate(self, cell: CellProfile) -> list[str]: ...
    def expand(self, cell: CellProfile) -> list[StepIntent]: ...
    def estimated_duration_h(self, cell: CellProfile) -> float: ...
    def to_dict(self) -> dict: ...
    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, data: dict) -> Self: ...
```

## 5. Additional Proposed Features (Requirement 4)

### 5.1 Safety and Validation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Safety envelope** | Automatically validate each step against the Cell Profile V/I limits |
| **Round-trip validator** | Writer output → reparse with ASSB `parse_sch_cycle_map_bytes` → compare with the original IR |
| **PNE simulator hook** | If possible, dry-run in the PNE PC simulator (manual verification checklist) |
| **StepNo continuity check** | Consecutive 1..N numbering, presence of an END step, and LOOP goto validity |

### 5.2 Productivity

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Template library** | Cell Profile integration with ASSB presets (`06_assb_design_stack`) |
| **Import existing .sch** | Reverse-parse a measured sch → IR → graph editing (reader extension) |
| **Clone & parameter sweep** | Sweep only C-rate / cycle count over the same structure → batch export |
| **Schedule fingerprint** | Compatible with ASSB `FrozenScheduleStructureFingerprint` — search for Sources with the same structure |
| **Human-readable export** | Step table in Excel/PDF (for attachment to process documents) |
| **Estimated duration / throughput** | Summary of total estimated time, energy, and cycle count |

### 5.3 Analysis Integration (pne_studio2 / ASSB Ecosystem)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ASSB classification hint** | Automatically tag the expected test type (formation/cycle/dcir) from the module combination |
| **C-rate display sync** | Use the same reference capacity as the ASSB Cell Manager `cell_c_rate_reference` schema |
| **Sampling preset** | Default Δt/ΔV/ΔQ values (resolve the UNKNOWN item in cyclediag IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP #16) |
| **Post-build checklist** | Guidance for `.cts` naming, `.ini` current range, and channel folder structure |

### 5.4 Advanced

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Conditional branching** | SOC/voltage conditional goto (`nGotoStepID` scenario) |
| **Multi-version export** | Same IR → selectable 0x00010003 / 0x00010007 output |
| **Chiller / thermal profile** | fTref, chiller fields (0x00010007) |
| **Version control** | `.schproj` git-friendly JSON + diff view |

### 5.5 Recommended Feature Order

The next product work should favor verifiable, template-preserving operations before
from-scratch binary generation.

| Priority | Feature | Why it belongs here | Dependency |
|----------|---------|---------------------|------------|
| P0 | **Safe export gate and build manifest** | Prevents experimental output from being mistaken for equipment-ready SCH; records source hash, schema evidence, target profile, and validation results | Available now |
| P0 | **Template-preserving SCH patcher** | Reuses a CTSPro-authored header and unknown bytes while changing only allowlisted, evidence-qualified fields | Controlled field pairs and reopen checks |
| P0 | **Semantic SCH diff** | Shows step-level intent changes instead of only raw bytes and can assert that the expected field alone changed | Reader field coverage |
| P0 | **Target equipment profile** | Makes PNE02/16/21/22, current range, CTSPro version, units, and supported layout explicit instead of inferring them from filenames | User/INI metadata |
| P1 | **Schedule linter and execution preview** | Detects invalid loops, missing END, unsafe V/I limits, unreachable steps, and implausible duration before export | IR and parser |
| P1 | **Read-only SCH → IR import** | Enables review, cloning, and diffing of existing schedules before editable round-trip is trusted | Semantic reader coverage |
| P1 | **Versioned protocol templates** | Makes Formation/Cycle/RPT/HPPC defaults reviewable and traceable by equipment profile | Golden module fixtures |
| P1 | **Autolab/LabVIEW-feel schedule workspace** | Procedure + module palette + property pane + library (authoring UX only) | Trusted IR + Gate C exit |
| P2 | **Parameter sweep and batch export** | Produces controlled variants after one template is verified | Safe patcher and manifest |
| P2 | **Approval/audit bundle** | Packages SCH hash, human-readable step table, diff report, screenshots, and operator approval | Stable export workflow |
| P3 | **Campaign / multi-module canvas** | Extra LabVIEW-like graph if procedure+modules UI is not enough | Gates D–E |

Features that should not be prioritized yet are live hardware control, automatic upload to
cycler PCs, realtime run plots, and broad 0x00010007/EIS generation. Their failure modes are
harder to inspect than offline file generation and they depend on unresolved schemas
or are simply outside the intended UX (authoring only).

### 5.6 Lessons from Gates A–C → permanent planning checks

These are **recurring failure modes** observed while closing A–C. Every later gate plan and
status update must pass this checklist (also use before claiming an exit criterion).

> A topic-grouped reading view of these lessons plus §8/§11 (evidence discipline,
> writer safety, status honesty, currently-open items) lives in
> [`GUARDRAILS.md`](GUARDRAILS.md). This table stays the authoritative source.

| # | Lesson (what went wrong or almost went wrong) | Permanent check |
|---|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| L1 | Assumed Excel / ASSB / Ensol / corpus agreed on offsets & units | Require an **evidence hierarchy**: controlled pair > reopen-verified fixture > corpus majority > Excel name. Document conflicts; do not silently pick one |
| L2 | Compiler wrote V while fixtures store mV (unit contract drift) | Any new packed field needs **unit + scale tests** before `writer_ready` |
| L3 | Invented / guessed maps (LOOP `+84`, DCR Excel offsets, 696 nonzero tails) without bytes | **No speculative packing.** Missing evidence → IR-only, waiver, or deferral in §11 |
| L4 | Marked tasks “done” against stronger wording than delivered (C6 “lab parity”, thin C4) | Exit criteria must match **deliverable depth**; if scope shrinks, **reframe the bar** and record waiver |
| L5 | Status tables went stale after code advanced (round-trip, Gate B blockers) | Status refresh is part of the change: ROADMAP §6 / §9 / §11 updated in the same PR as the claim |
| L6 | From-scratch `build` looked “done” before equipment reopen | **Never** label executable without C5/F-class reopen for that artifact class |
| L7 | Filename / stack inference tempting for Q_nom and equipment | Writer path: **explicit profile only**; inference is viewer/analysis-only |
| L8 | Skipping evidence promotion process burned time; waivers unblocked correctly | Controlled-pair **or** documented waiver before promoting `writer_ready` |
| L9 | Dual writer paths confused risk (patch vs build) | Prefer **`patch-sch`** for near-term lab edits; keep `build` experimental until reopen proves framing |
| L10 | Software work continued past the only true blocker (C5) | When lab-blocked, **pause non-support software** and push user action items |
| L11 | Hosted CI / badge lag treated as Gate A “done” signal | Local green ≠ release; F6 is separate |
| L12 | UX/export prioritized before trusted writer | **No semantic export UX (E3+)** until Gate C exit (or explicit waiver) |
| L13 | Worse than L11 anticipated: hosted CI didn't just lag, it existed, was active, and was **red for 12 consecutive commits** (2026-09-02→03) while ROADMAP still claimed Gate F6 "not started" — nothing in the process ever checked GitHub's actual workflow status against the doc | Periodically verify external status (CI, badges) against ROADMAP claims, not just local `pytest`; use a real GitHub Actions status badge in README (not a static hand-set one) so silent red CI is visible on the repo front page instead of requiring someone to remember to check |

**Gate planning template (paste into new gate notes):**

```text
[ ] Evidence hierarchy named for each new packed field
[ ] Unit/scale tests added or N/A justified
[ ] No invented offsets (corpus or pair cited)
[ ] Exit criteria wording matches actual depth
[ ] ROADMAP status rows updated with the claim
[ ] Executable / equipment-ready label? → reopen record required
[ ] Writer uses explicit CellProfile / equipment profile only
[ ] writer_ready promotion: pair or §11 waiver
[ ] Near-term path: patch-sch vs experimental build stated
[ ] If blocked on lab/user: USER_ACTION_ITEMS updated; software paused
```

**Can these checks govern future plans?** **Yes.** They are process constraints, not one-off notes.
Gate D/E/F task definitions below already inherit them; new work that fails the template should
not be marked done.

---

## 6. Implementation Roadmap

Work proceeds **Gate A → B → C → D → E** in order for anything that reads on
an equipment-readiness claim; **F and G then run in parallel** (see the diagram below). That said, most of D/E/F's *individual tasks* have
no equipment dependency at all. The remaining physical checkpoints are pattern PV1/PV4
(controlled pairs and CTSPro batch reopen), optional PV6/F3 execution, and any new exact-artifact
release approval. E3/E3.1 **UI implementation itself** is software-only; applying a verified label
inherits the pattern/F-gate evidence. **2026-09-06: user authorized starting
equipment-independent D/E/F work in parallel with the C5 wait** instead of waiting for C5 to close Gate C first.
Do not start a later Gate's *equipment-dependent* tasks until the current gate's
exit criteria are met (or an explicit waiver is recorded in §11) — the ordering
rule is about claims and equipment-facing work, not about every line item.

```
Gate A  개발 기반          ✅ complete (local)
  ↓
Gate B  바이너리 스키마    ✅ complete
  ↓
Gate C  호환 SCH writer    ✅ exited 2026-09-08 (C5 PNE02)
  ↓                         (parallel track below can run now, per-task)
Gate D  모듈 픽스처 검증   ✅ software exit 2026-09-08 (P0/P1)
  ↓
Gate E  모듈형 스케줄 UX   🔄 active — desktop workspace shipped 2026-09-09
  ↓
  ├─ Gate F  운영 릴리스 / 추적성  F5/F6 unblocked; F1–F4 need release-record work
  └─ Gate G  웹 UI (Next.js)      ✅ complete 2026-09-09 — desktop shells removed
```

Gate G is **not** downstream of Gate F. They touch different things — F records what an
artifact is, G changes what draws the screen — and neither blocks the other.

Before claiming any gate **exit**, run the §5.6 checklist — this still applies in
full; only the "when can I start the next gate's software-only tasks" question
changed.

### 6.0 Gate maintenance rules

When new problems appear during implementation:

1. **Log first** — add a row to §11 *Discovered issues backlog* with date, gate, severity, and owner.
2. **Assign a gate** — blocking schema/writer issues stay in B or C; module fidelity → D; UX → E; release process → F.
3. **Update the active gate** — move tasks into that gate’s task table and mark status (`open` / `in progress` / `done`).
4. **Record resolution** — close the §11 row when exit criteria or a documented waiver is met.
5. **Do not skip gates** — if Gate C is blocked by a B item, fix B first; do not mark C complete with a hidden dependency.

Status labels used below: `✅ done` · `🔄 in progress` · `⏳ not started` · `⚠️ blocked`

### 6.1 Repository Assessment Results as of 2026-09-03

| Area | Status | Evidence / assessment |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| Original fixtures | **Secured** | 102-file catalog + archives; Gate B controlled pairs under `example/gate_b_pairs/` |
| File reading/viewer | **Usable** | Registry-first 612/696 layout detection; structural goldens; Ensol-aligned display fields |
| Equipment provenance | **Partially classified** | Explicit intake metadata required; filename inference prohibited |
| Classification/stack/C-rate inference | **Partially complete** | Unit tests + analysis reports; viewer-only Q_nom inference |
| `.schproj` IR/JSON | **Partially complete** | Serialization and linear DAG sorting; no schema version migration yet |
| Experiment modules | **prototype** | `expand` for Formation, Cycle Life, RPT, DC-IR, HPPC, capacheck, QPEED, smoke |
| Binary compiler | **C2 done (with DCR gap)** | Mode, end, loop/goto, sampling, SOC packed; DCR remains IR-only |
| SCH writer | **Software-complete pending C5** | Full `0x10003` header; `0x10004` framing; still experimental until equipment smoke |
| Round-trip validator | **C3 done** | `validate/roundtrip.py` semantic field compare on Ensol offsets |
| ASSB cross-check | **C4 thin-but-green** | Layout/step parity + limited field overlap (`fEndC`); not full semantic ASSB parity |
| GUI | **Partially complete** | Viewer/resume/flow editor exist; export still gated |
| Test execution environment | **Restored, hosted CI green** | Local `pytest` green (264+). `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (live since 2026-09-02) was red for 12 consecutive commits on an `access_parser` collection bug; fixed and pushed 2026-09-06 (`d60ea3b`) — [run #33](https://github.com/Hwiho/pne_scheduler/actions/runs/34037824999) is green (Ruff + Pytest + corpus smoke) |

---

### 6.2 Gate A — Restore the Development Baseline

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ **Complete** (local) |
| **Depends on** | — |
| **Exit criteria** | Clean editable install; pytest green; 102-fixture inventory locked |
| **Next gate** | Gate B |

| # | Task | Status | Completion criteria |
|---|------|--------|---------------------|
| A1 | Fix `pyproject.toml` package discovery/source layout | ✅ | `import pne_scheduler` succeeds after editable install in a clean environment |
| A2 | Establish the test command and CI baseline | ✅ | `python -m pytest tests/ -q` passes; README shows a live GitHub Actions status badge (2026-09-06, replacing a static hand-set count that could go stale) |
| A3 | Add fixture inventory tests | ✅ | ZIP counts (8, 93) + HPPC presence verified automatically |

**Notes:** A hosted CI workflow already exists (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, since 2026-09-02) — "hosted CI" is not a Gate A/F gap in the sense of "not built," only in the sense of "not currently green" (see §6.1, §11). Full CI maturity (F6: packaging, schema-invariant checks, doc checks on every PR) remains future work. Local pass count is not equipment-compatibility evidence regardless of CI color.

**Progress record**
- A1: package/subpackage imports verified from editable install and clean-target wheel
- A3: 8 + 93 + 1 HPPC = 102 fixtures locked
- A2: 252 tests pass locally (1 skipped, lab-only); README badge synced (2026-09-06)

### 6.3 Gate B — Establish the Binary Schema as the Single Source of Truth

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ **Passed** (`gate_b_passed=true`, 2026-09-03) |
| **Depends on** | Gate A |
| **Exit criteria** | Raw-unit contract resolved; parser/schema/compiler agree; semantic goldens for representative fixtures; intake metadata gates evidence promotion |
| **Next gate** | Gate C |

| # | Task | Status | Completion criteria |
|---|------|--------|---------------------|
| B0 | Define PNE raw-unit/profile mapping | ✅ | mV/mA scaling, offset `+12`/`+16`/`+20`, INI current-range per target profile |
| B1 | Header/step field tables for 612/696 | ✅ | Offset, dtype, size, version in one registry (`schema/fields.py`); 696 tail deferred to C6 |
| B2 | Parser/schema/compiler offset alignment | ✅ | `fEndV`, `fEndI`, shared-prefix fields aligned; ASSB divergences documented |
| B3 | Read regression over all 102 files | ✅ | Version, payload offset, step size/count cataloged |
| B4 | Semantic golden tests | ✅ | `GOLDEN_SEMANTIC_EXPECTATIONS.json` + 7 fixture byte checks; parser cross-check |
| B5 | Controlled-pair intake validation | ✅ | PNE02 pairs reopen-verified; PNE16 `fIref`/`fVref` waived via shared-prefix evidence |

**Recommended order inside Gate B:** B0 → B5 → B2 → B4 → finish B1 unknowns.

**Progress record**
- B1 partial: evidence registry with confidence levels; LOOP at `+48/+52` confirmed
- B3: `example/fixtures/catalog.json` locks geometry and provenance for 102 files
- End-condition offsets unified: `fEndV=28`, `fEndI=32`, `fEndC=36` across parser/schema/compiler
- Intake tooling: `tools/compare_sch`, `docs/GATE_B.md`
- **Ensol sch_maker adoption (2026-09-01):** validated 612-byte map — `+12` mV setpoint, `+16` mA current, `+20` s duration, `+28`/`+32` end V/I; parser + compiler updated; golden capacheck regression
- **Corpus evidence pass (2026-09-02):** 23,281 schedules mined; canonical 612-byte
  sampling, DOD, capacity-reference, and loop fields registered as `corpus_inferred`.
- **Gate B exit (2026-09-03):** `gate_b_passed=true`. PNE02 controlled pairs cover
  `fVref`, `fIref`, `fEndV`, `fEndI`, `loop_count`, `loop_target`, `record_time_s`.
  PNE16 `fIref`/`fVref` waived via shared-prefix evidence
  (`planning/GATE_B_CONTROLLED_PAIR_WAIVERS.json`).
- Writer Q_nom is fail-safe and explicit: only
  `CellProfile.nominal_capacity_mAh` may drive compilation; stack/filename inference is
  viewer-only.

**Blocking items (see also §11):** PNE voltage/L-level encoding; dual capacity models (viewer vs writer Q_nom).

---

### 6.4 Gate C — Actually Compatible SCH Writer

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ **Exited 2026-09-08** (C5 PNE02 smoke passed; gaps documented) |
| **Depends on** | Gate B exit (`gate_b_passed=true`) |
| **Exit criteria (original)** | 612 writer round-trips semantically; 696 lab parity; PNE PC smoke test recorded; no placeholder header |
| **Exit criteria (accepted 2026-09-03 / closed 2026-09-08)** | Software slice C0–C4 + C6 framing; **C5 signed on PNE02**; remaining gaps: DCR IR-only, 696 tail unused, CLI header 54-byte unexplained region |
| **Next gate** | Gate D (in progress) |

| # | Task | Status | Completion criteria | Honest note |
|---|------|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| C0 | Guard experimental output | ✅ | Default CLI blocks `build`; explicit flag + warning | Solid |
| C0.1 | Build validation manifest | ✅ | Manifest on every write path | Solid |
| C0.2 | Template-preserving patch slice | ✅ | Writer-ready allowlist + byte preservation | **Preferred near-term lab path** vs from-scratch `build` |
| C1 | Full header for `0x00010003` | ✅ | No 512-byte placeholder; 1760 B framing | Solid |
| C2 | Step compiler | ✅ | mode, end, loop/goto, sampling, SOC | **DCR not packed** (Excel≠Ensol); intentional |
| C3 | Internal round-trip | ✅ | Semantic write→read on Ensol offsets | Covers smoke/intent fields; not every module E2E (that is Gate D) |
| C4 | ASSB cross-check | ✅ | Layout + step-count + overlapping fields | **Thin**: shared ASSB candidate compare is mostly `fEndC`; currents checked via ASSB helpers. Do not read as full ASSB semantic parity |
| C5 | PNE PC smoke test | ✅ | CTSEditorPro reopen (+ optional run) recorded | **Passed PNE02 2026-09-08** — checklist filled; DOD/SOC UI optional not shown |
| C6 | `0x00010004/696` | ✅ *reframed* | Header 1844 + 696 steps (612 prefix + zero tail) | Original “696 lab parity / semantically verified” **not** fully claimed. Secured corpus tails are all-zero; writer matches that. Nonzero-tail mapping deferred until evidence appears |

**Recommended order:** ~~run C5~~ → Gate D module fidelity → Gate E authoring UX.

#### Gate C honest assessment (2026-09-03; C5 closed 2026-09-08)

**What went right (direction is sound)**
1. Gate order respected: B evidence → C0 safety → C1 header → C2 compiler → C3/C4 validators before equipment.
2. Dual writer strategy is correct: `patch-sch` (template-preserving, evidence-gated) is safer for near-term lab use; from-scratch `build` stays experimental until C5.
3. Refusing to invent DCR / 696-tail semantics without bytes in corpus was the right call.
4. C5 equipment reopen closed Gate C — capacity slot fix (`+12`) and Cycle-free LOOP probe were the last lab lessons.

**Where status was overstated (corrected here)**
1. **C6** was marked done against a stronger original bar (“696 lab parity / semantically verified”). Accepted bar is now: **framing + corpus-aligned zero-tail policy**. Full 696 semantic parity of complex lab schedules remains future work if tails become nonzero or if module E2E (Gate D) requires it.
2. **C4** is a useful smoke cross-check, not deep ASSB field-by-field validation of writer outputs.
3. **§6.1** previously still said round-trip was incomplete — that was stale after C3.
4. **§11** still listed some Gate B items as open/blocking after `gate_b_passed` — cleaned below.

**Optimal next moves**
| Priority | Action | Why |
|--------:|--------|-----|
| 1 | Gate D P0 harness + Formation/Rest/Cycle Life | Software-only module fidelity |
| 2 | Prefer `patch-sch` for real schedule edits until CLI `build_sch_header` gap is understood | Lower risk than from-scratch builds for production edits |
| 3 | OCV/Impedance/Balance controlled pairs when lab time allows | Type codes stubbed; field map empty in corpus |
| 4 | Do **not** invent 696-tail or DCR binary maps | Wait for nonzero evidence / controlled pairs |
| 5 | Documented Gate C gaps remain: DCR IR-only; 696 tail unused; 54 header bytes | Keeps exit criteria honest |

**Rules**
- Label CLI `build` as equipment-smoke-verified for the probe class only; new type classes (OCV/Imp/…) need their own reopen
- C6 “complete” means framing/corpus policy only unless upgraded later
- Apply §5.6 checklist when claiming any further C/D work complete

**Progress record**
- C0 / C0.1 / C0.2 / C1 / C2 / C3 / C4: implemented 2026-09-03 (see git history `dbf7fed`…`1eeceb3`)
- C5: checklist [`GATE_C_EQUIPMENT_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md`](../legacy/planning/GATE_C_EQUIPMENT_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md); smoke assets `example/smoke_rest_cc_end.*` (kept as a fallback)
- C5 (2026-09-06): field-by-field evidence audit against `schema/fields.py`,
  `GATE_B_CORPUS_EVIDENCE.json`, `GOLDEN_SEMANTIC_EXPECTATIONS.json`, and all 9
  reopen-verified PNE02 pairs — see [`GATE_C5_EVIDENCE_COVERAGE.md`](../legacy/planning/GATE_C5_EVIDENCE_COVERAGE.md).
  Conclusion: every writer-ready/high-confidence field was already individually
  reopen- or corpus-verified; the only genuinely untested axis was a from-scratch
  build combining charge+discharge+LOOP+per-step sampling in one header. Added a
  single combinatorial fixture (`modules/smoke_writer_probe.py`,
  `example/smoke_writer_probe.sch`) so one physical reopen covers that instead of
  several separate sessions; checklist rewritten around it. Byte-diffing
  `build_sch_header()` against a real lab header also surfaced 54/1760 unexplained
  header bytes (see §11) — logged, not packed (no evidence for their meaning yet).
- **C5 (2026-09-08):** PNE02 CTSEditorPro smoke **passed** on `smoke_writer_probe.sch`
  (open/save, capacity 800 mAh, charge/discharge/LOOP/END, optional channel run).
  DOD/SOC 40% not shown in UI (optional). Common-safety Cap confirmed at `+12`.
- C6: [`SCH_696_TAIL_ANALYSIS.md`](../legacy/planning/SCH_696_TAIL_ANALYSIS.md) — 92 catalog fixtures / 2056 steps, zero nonzero tails
- Extended types: [`STEP_TYPES_EXTENDED.md`](STEP_TYPES_EXTENDED.md)
- User action list: [`USER_ACTION_ITEMS.md`](USER_ACTION_ITEMS.md)

### 6.5 Gate D — Experiment Module Fixture Fidelity

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ **P0/P1 software exit 2026-09-08** — re-verified via [`GATE_D_VERIFICATION.md`](GATE_D_VERIFICATION.md) (`gate_d_passed=true`) |
| **Depends on** | Gate C2 + C3 (both done) — **not** blocked on equipment |
| **Exit criteria** | Every P0 module passes `validate → expand → compile → parse → semantic compare` in one integration test |
| **Next gate** | Gate E |
| **Verification** | Method + audit + runner: [`GATE_D_VERIFICATION.md`](GATE_D_VERIFICATION.md), [`GATE_D_VERIFICATION_AUDIT.md`](GATE_D_VERIFICATION_AUDIT.md), `python -m pne_scheduler.tools.run_gate_d_verification` → [`GATE_D_VALIDATION_REPORT.json`](GATE_D_VALIDATION_REPORT.json) |

Gate D is software-only. Module expands are **protocol templates**; golden compares use step-type *families* (`validate/topology.py`), not byte-identical clones. DCR binary packing stays IR-only (L3).

| Priority | Module / harness | Status | Validation fixture / criteria | Needs equipment? |
|----------|------------------|--------|-------------------------------|:---:|
| P0 | Integration harness | ✅ | `validate/gate_d_harness.py` + `tests/test_gate_d_harness.py` | No |
| P0 | Capacity model contract | ✅ | `tests/test_capacity_contract.py` — writer Q_nom only; viewer may disagree (L7) | No |
| P0 | Formation, Cycle Life, Rest | ✅ | Harness topology/I/V + golden family (`golden-formation-696`, `golden-cycle-612-long`) | No |
| P0 | RPT, DC-IR | ✅ | SOC ladder + pulse topology; DCR warnings; Excel DCR offsets remain 0 | No |
| P1 | HPPC | ✅ | Harness + `HPPC_Full range.sch` family (charge/discharge/rest) | No |
| P1 | capacheck, QPEED, in-situ | ✅ | Harness + golden families; QPEED `full`/`soc_setting`; in-situ label | No |

**Recommended order inside Gate D:** ~~harness → capacity → modules~~ done.

**Planning check:** §5.6 (especially L3 DCR evidence, L7 capacity contract, L4 honest exit depth). Extended step types (OCV/Imp/Balance) remain stubbed pending lab pairs (`STEP_TYPES_EXTENDED.md`) — outside Gate D module rows.

**Honest gaps remaining after Gate D software exit**
- Modules ≠ full lab schedule length/order (templates by design)
- `fEndC@36` packs but stays `semantic_unverified` (warnings expected on RPT/DCIR/HPPC)
- DCR window never packed without controlled pairs

### 6.6 Gate E — Modular Schedule UX (Nova + LabVIEW feel)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 🔄 **Partial** (E0/E0.5/E1/E2/E2.1/E2.3/E2.4/E3/E3.1/E4 ✅ — E2.3/E4 closed by G0; E2.2 waiting on CTSPro reopen; E5–E7 ⏳) |
| **Depends on** | **Nothing blocking as of 2026-09-08** — E0–E2.4 never needed a trusted writer, and E3/E3.1's Gate C exit dependency was satisfied by the C5 PNE02 pass. Export UX is now gated by *evidence discipline* (§5.6 L6/L9), not by an unmet gate |
| **Exit criteria** | Schedule authoring feels like **module + procedure** composition (Nova/LabVIEW-like); multi-module END/LOOP composition is safe; pattern trust is visible; unsafe export blocked; library + Cell setup; byte-preserving imported patch session |
| **Next gate** | Gate F |
| **UX intent** | §1.1 — design *feel* for making schedules with modules; **not** Autolab instrument control |

Framing history: Gate E was once blanket-marked "depends on Gate C exit," which
over-blocked the authoring-UI tasks (E0–E2.4) — none of them write or export a
`.sch`, so none needed a trusted writer. That split was corrected 2026-09-06, and
on **2026-09-08 the C5 pass cleared the remaining E3/E3.1 dependency too**, so no
Gate E task is gate-blocked any more. What still constrains export is the standing
evidence discipline, not a pending gate: prefer `patch-sch` over from-scratch
`build` for production edits (L9), and never label output equipment-ready without
a reopen record for that exact artifact (L6, §6.7 F1–F4).

| # | Task | Status | Completion criteria | UX cue | Needs equipment? |
|---|------|--------|---------------------|--------|:---:|
| E0 | UX contract & IA | ✅ | Screens: Setup / Procedure / Modules / Library / Validate / Export; map to `ui/` | Clean authoring layout | No |
| E0.5 | Composer / catalog / validator contract | ✅ | One final END; module-local LOOP refs rebased; structured issues; pattern metadata/trust | Safe foundation | No |
| E1 | Viewer/resume/bulk editor regression | ✅ | Fixture-based GUI/CLI regression coverage | Review existing schedules | No |
| | ↳ 2026-09-09: `tests/test_tk_tools.py` builds the viewer, project editor, flow editor and resume wizard headless against real fixtures and asserts each one actually populated — the failure a constructor smoke test misses, since a tool that renders an empty table looks fine from outside. Mutation-checked: breaking `load_file` fails two of them. Skips without a display, as the workspace smoke test does. | | | |
| E2 | **Procedure editor** (ordered steps) | ✅ | Insert/reorder/delete primitives; property pane; C-rate ↔ mA preview | Nova-like step list | No |
| | ↳ 2026-09-09: module level and step level both complete. `edit/steps.py` inserts/removes/moves/retypes the steps of a detached module — non-empty and END-last enforced there — and the 절차 tab draws them with per-field editors carrying each value's derived counterpart. A preset shows no editor: editing one in place would break the golden-topology claim, so detaching stays the explicit gate. | | | |
| E2.1 | Primitive palette | ✅ | REST, CC, CCCV, CV, LOOP, END, OCV… with validated forms | Command blocks | No |
| | ↳ 2026-09-09: `modules/primitive.py` ships REST/OCV/CC/CCCV/CV charge and CC discharge as one-step modules with spec-driven forms. **LOOP and END are deliberately absent** as palette items: the composer owns the final END, and a LOOP target must resolve inside its own fragment (`1 <= target < position`), so repetition is `repeat_count`, which emits the LOOP and its target together. The catalog entry states both exclusions. | | | |
| E2.2 | **Module/pattern palette** | 🔄 | Variant + units + evidence status; only accepted Formation/Cycle/QC/RPT/HPPC/QPEED recipes promoted | LabVIEW-like modules | No |
| | ↳ 2026-09-09: `protocol/recipes.py` gives a purpose-first goal catalog carrying `trust_status`, surfaced in the UI via `TRUST_LABELS_KO`. Promotion stays open: no pattern has a CTSPro reopen record, so everything still shows as `prototype`. | | | |
| E2.3 | Method / project library | ✅ | Save/load versioned procedures & modules per equipment profile | Reusable methods | No |
| | ↳ 2026-09-09: `library.py` stores methods as append-only versions under `~/.pne_scheduler/library`, each recording the unit and SCH layout it was written for. Loading onto a different profile warns rather than blocks, ids are reassigned to avoid collision, and every load states that saved ≠ verified. `pne_scheduler library` lists them. Reached a user via G0 on the same day: `pne_scheduler library --save <project> --name <name>` writes a version and the listing shows it. | | | |
| E2.4 | Cell / equipment setup pane | ✅ | Explicit 1C mA, V limits, PNE unit/range, layout target; blocks export if missing | Setup before edit | No (the pane itself; it just *displays* a profile that later needs equipment-verified export) |
| E3 | Pre-export validation UX | ✅ | Block invalid loops, missing END, V/I violations | Readiness before export | No — **unblocked by the 2026-09-08 C5 pass** |
| E3.1 | Export path choice | ✅ | Default **patch-sch** onto approved template; optional experimental `build` | PNE safety | No — unblocked, but keep `patch-sch` as the default path per L9 |
| | ↳ 2026-09-09: template patch now precedes the from-scratch build in the ladder and carries `recommended=True` — a 권장 badge and highlighted button in the export tab, a `← 권장` marker in `pne_scheduler summary`. The build is retitled 실험적 and keeps `danger=True`. Tests assert the ordering and that exactly one option is recommended. | | | |
| E4 | `.sch` imported patch session | ✅ | Preserve source hash/raw bytes; writer-ready edits only; lossy `Clone as draft` separate | Open existing schedule | No — parser exists; safe session model does not |
| | ↳ 2026-09-09: `import_session.py` holds the source bytes and digest, offers only `get_writer_ready_fields()` for in-place editing, and emits an `SchPatchPlan` bound to the digest it read. Measured on a real 0x00010004 lab file: one float edit changes **2 bytes** and the 1760-byte CTSPro header is untouched. `Clone as draft` is a separate exit that names everything it discards. `pne_scheduler import-sch` reports both. Completed via G0: `SchPatchPlan.to_dict()/save()` plus `import-sch --set ... --plan-out`, so propose → save → `patch-sch` runs end to end. Measured again on the fixture: 2 bytes changed, header identical. | | | |
| E5 | Advanced: 0x00010007/EIS, fingerprint | ⏳ | Deferred until explicit schema evidence | Later | No (blocked on schema evidence, not equipment) |
| E6 | pne_studio2 integration | ⏳ | Shared cell profile and export workflow | Host embedding | Partial — integration itself is No; the export half inherits E3's block |
| E7 | Campaign canvas (optional) | ⏳ | Free-form multi-module graph **only if** E2–E2.2 is insufficient | Extra LabVIEW canvas | No |

**Progress record**
- 2026-09-09: **the unified workspace shipped** — one window for 설정 → 프로토콜 → 절차 → 검증 →
  내보내기, with PySide6/QML (`ui/workspace_qt.py` + `ui/qml/`) as the default shell and the Tk
  build (`ui/workspace.py`) as the fallback where PySide6 is absent. Neither shell decides
  anything: both drive `ui/workspace_model.py`, which has no Qt and no Tk import and is covered by
  `tests/test_workspace_model.py`. New supporting contracts: `spec/` (one declaration per
  parameter — unit, allowed/recommended range, basis, affected steps, verification level),
  `ir/loader.py` (lenient load that lists every repair), `ir/procedure.py` (module list is
  authoritative over the wiring), `ir/equipment_profile.py` (schproj v2 carries the target
  cycler; v1 migrates on save), `release.py`/`exporting.py` (staged export gates) and
  `report/summary.py` (Korean prose summary). 424 passed, 1 skipped; ruff clean.
  CI now installs the `[gui]` extra and asserts PySide6 is importable, so the default UI's
  coverage cannot silently skip — the L13 failure mode applied to a new surface.
- Detailed re-audited execution order and acceptance criteria:
  [`GATE_E_PLAN.md`](GATE_E_PLAN.md). Pattern implementation/reopen is a linked track:
  [`PATTERN_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](PATTERN_VALIDATION_PLAN.md).
- 2026-09-09: E0.5 composer/catalog/preflight complete; HPPC 62-step, QPEED 167/11-step and QC 3종
  candidates implemented. Deterministic 10-pattern PNE02 batch is at
  [`../example/pattern_review_pack/2026-09-09/INDEX.md`](../example/pattern_review_pack/2026-09-09/INDEX.md).
  Every manifest remains `equipment_executable=false`; user PV4 reopen is still required.
- `pne_scheduler flow` / `run_pne_scheduler_flow.py`: linear graph, `.schproj` load/save, Cell Profile, step preview — **seed** for E2/E2.2
- 2026-09-06: found 3 abandoned Cursor Cloud branches with substantial unmerged UI work directly relevant to E2/E2.2/E2.3 (theming, recipe editing, schedule explanation) — see §6.6.1
- 2026-09-06: **ported the `cursor/update-roadmap-5ac9` theming + attach/detach work** (§6.6.1's first recommendation) — `ui/flow_theme.py` (per-module-type card colors/icons, rounded-card Tk Canvas rendering), `engine/duration.py` (schedule duration estimate with loop/CV-taper caveats surfaced as warnings, not silently dropped), and `FlowProjectModel.rewire()` (LabVIEW-style click-port-then-click-port attach/detach, reusing existing cycle validation). Added `ModuleStyle` entries for `smoke_rest_cc_end`/`smoke_writer_probe` (module types that didn't exist when the branch was written). 273 tests pass (was 264); GUI construction + rewire + duration estimate smoke-tested non-interactively (`tk.Tk()` + `withdraw()`, no visible window in this environment — a human should still open it once to confirm the visual result)
- Remaining for the intended feel: module palette prominence (E2.2), richer property forms (E2.1, still raw JSON), library (E2.3, `cursor/module-recipes-presets-5ac9`'s recipe concept is the recommended next port per `UI_UX_NOTES.md`), validation/export UX (E3 — **no longer gate-blocked** since the 2026-09-08 C5 pass), full undo/redo (the new `rewire()`'s returned notes are a natural logging seam for this, not yet wired to an undo stack)

**Rules**
- E3/E3.1 semantic export is **unblocked** (C5 passed 2026-09-08), but keep `patch-sch` the default export path and `build` explicitly experimental until the CLI header's 54-byte unexplained region is understood (L9, §11)
- Do not treat Gate D family-level green as protocol-pattern approval. SOC-dependent patterns
  also require separate DOD@384 and `fEndC@36` evidence as specified in the pattern plan.
- “Nova/LabVIEW-like” means **authoring interaction**, not feature parity with those products
- Apply §5.6 checklist on every E-task completion claim

#### 6.6.1 Prior art to check before building E0–E2.4 (found 2026-09-06)

Six unmerged `cursor/*` remote branches exist (Cursor Cloud background-agent runs,
never merged, diverged from master by up to 53 commits). Three touch the UI
directly and should be reviewed **before** starting fresh implementation of the
authoring UI, to avoid redoing work that already exists in some form:

| Branch | Touches | Relevance |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `cursor/update-roadmap-5ac9` | `ui/flow_theme.py` (new, doesn't exist on master), heavy `ui/flow_editor.py` rework | Direct prior attempt at LabVIEW-style visual theming + wire/port interaction — exactly E2.2's "LabVIEW-like modules" cue |
| `cursor/module-recipes-presets-5ac9` | `ui/flow_editor.py`, `ui/flow_model.py`, `validate/roundtrip.py` | "Recipe" concept for charge/discharge/rest presets + a "pattern overview" — overlaps E2.1 (primitive palette) and E2.3 (library) |
| `cursor/explain-schedules-5ac9` | `ui/schedule_viewer.py`, `protocol/infer.py` | Plain-language schedule explanation — a plausible E3/Validate-screen feature once Gate C exits |

All three are **stale relative to current master** (diverged well before this
session's bug fixes and the C5 probe work) — treat them as design reference /
cherry-pick candidates, not as branches to merge wholesale. See
[`UI_UX_NOTES.md`](UI_UX_NOTES.md) for the extracted patterns and concrete
recommendations. The other 3 branches (`cursor/create-gate-b-baseline-dfb2`,
`cursor/gate-c-safety-manifest-eccb`, `cursor/mine-internal-dataset-dfb2`) touch
Gate B/C validation tooling, not UI — lower priority to review, listed in §11.

### 6.7 Gate F — Operational Release and Traceability

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ⏳ **Not started on F1–F5**; **F6 done**. The C5 probe artifact can enter release-record work. A product release containing HPPC/QPEED/QC/Cycle presets still depends on the selected pattern pack's acceptance evidence |
| **Depends on** | For the exact C5 smoke artifact: record/hash work only. For authored pattern output: [`PATTERN_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](PATTERN_VALIDATION_PLAN.md) PV4–PV5, plus PV6 if `equipment-run-verified` is claimed |
| **Exit criteria** | Equipment-verified artifact with immutable hash, documented profile, hosted CI |
| **Next gate** | — (maintenance / version bumps) |

| # | Task | Status | Completion criteria | Needs equipment? |
|---|------|--------|---------------------|:---:|
| F1 | Target equipment compatibility report | ⏳ | PNE unit/range, CTSPro version, layout, pattern/release scope, open assumptions | No for the C5 probe write-up; pattern scope waits on PV4–PV5 records |
| F2 | Reopen approval record | ⏳ | Exact SHA-256 opens in CTSPro; operator result logged | C5 source record exists for the smoke probe; every released pattern candidate needs its own hash/result in the batch pack |
| F3 | Equipment smoke-test protocol | ⏳ | Dummy-cell procedure, abort criteria, signed result | Partly — the C5 reopen is done; a *run* protocol (dummy cell, abort criteria) still needs a lab session if execution is to be claimed |
| F4 | Artifact immutability | ⏳ | Released hash == smoke-tested hash; reapproval on change | No — pin the C5-verified `smoke_writer_probe.sch` hash and gate re-release on change |
| F5 | Release status labels | ✅ | `analysis-only` / `CTSPro-reopen-verified` / `equipment-verified` in CLI/UI | No — the label enum/plumbing can be built now; only *applying* `equipment-verified` needs F1–F4 |
| F6 | Hosted CI | 🔄 **exists, green, now self-reporting** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs Ruff + pytest + `tools/compare_pne_units.py` on push/PR since 2026-09-02; was red for 12 commits on the `access_parser` collection bug, fixed and pushed 2026-09-06 (`d60ea3b`, [run #33](https://github.com/Hwiho/pne_scheduler/actions/runs/34037824999) success). README now shows the workflow's own live status badge instead of a static hand-set count, so a future red run is visible on the repo front page. Remaining F6 scope: packaging checks, schema-invariant checks, doc checks on every PR | No |

**Rule:** No “equipment-ready” label until F1–F4 pass for the **exact** artifact, recipe
version, and target profile. The C5 combinatorial probe proves shared writer assembly; it does not
automatically approve a different HPPC/QPEED/QC/Cycle topology. F5's label mechanism can exist
before that — it just cannot promote an unapproved pattern.

---

### 6.8 Gate G — Web UI (Next.js)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ **Complete 2026-09-09** — G0–G5 done. The web app is the workspace; the Tk and Qt shells are deleted |
| **Depends on** | **Nothing blocking.** G0 also closes what E2.3/E4 left unreachable. Does *not* depend on Gate F — release-record work and the UI re-platform are independent |
| **Exit criteria** | The web UI is the default entry point; `release.py` still owns every gate; the API never lets a client compute `equipment_executable`; the Tk and Qt shells are removed rather than maintained in parallel |
| **Next gate** | — (Gate F runs alongside, not after) |
| **Boundary** | Split by whether an operation touches equipment-facing bytes — not by layer. Server stays on the lab PC; the core API is stateless |

The port is affordable because `ui/workspace_model.py` never imported Qt or Tk, and
`ScheduleProject` already round-trips through `to_dict`/`from_dict` (`copy()` is built on
it). An undo entry is already a project snapshot, so the undo stack belongs in the client
and the server holds no session. Measured split: 5,691 lines of UI that gets discarded
against 6,561 lines of shell-free logic that carries over.

| # | Task | Status | Completion criteria | Needs equipment? |
|---|------|--------|---------------------|:---:|
| G0 | Unblock the stateless path | ✅ | `WorkspaceModel` usable without pushing undo; `SchPatchPlan.to_dict()`; a user-reachable way to save a method. **Closes E2.3 and E4** | No |
| G1 | Python API — derive / transform / plan | ✅ | `POST /api/views`, `/api/edit/{action}`, `/api/plan/{action}`; no filesystem access in this group; existing 591 tests stand as the contract | No |
| G2 | Next.js screens | ✅ | 설정 / 프로토콜 / 절차 / 검증 / 내보내기; forms rendered from `spec/` metadata rather than hand-written; undo/redo and autosave in the browser | No |
| G3 | Local-resource API | ✅ | `/api/library`, `/api/import/*`, `/api/export/*` — the only group touching the filesystem, and the line to hold if anything is ever centralised | No |
| G4 | Retire the desktop shells | ✅ | `ui/workspace.py` and `ui/workspace_qt.py` + `qml/` removed; launchers point at the web app; `[gui]` extra dropped | No |
| G5 | Lab-PC deployment | ✅ | One script starts both processes on localhost; documented in README with the same PowerShell examples as the current tools | No |

**Rules**

- **Gates stay in `release.py`.** The API reports a decision; it never asks the client to
  make one. The moment a browser computes `equipment_executable`, the safety model is gone.
- **No central server that can emit equipment files** — §3.1 of the plan. Only the method
  library is worth centralising later, and it writes no equipment file.
- **Do not back-port features to Tk.** It is a reduced fallback scheduled for removal in G4;
  eight features added 2026-09-09 are Qt-only and stay that way.
- **No web dependency in `ui/workspace_model.py`.** Keeping Qt and Tk out of it is what made
  this port cheap; the same rule applies to whatever replaces the web UI later.

**Progress record**
- 2026-09-09: boundary and API shape settled — [`WEB_PORT_PLAN.md`](WEB_PORT_PLAN.md).
  The model's 50 public methods fall into exactly four groups (derive / transform / plan /
  local resource), and that split *is* the endpoint design. Keeping plan separate from
  transform preserves the preview-then-apply step that carries warnings such as the DC-IR
  resistance window never reaching the equipment file.

Gate G adds two directories beside the package and removes `ui/workspace*.py` + `ui/qml/`:

```
api/                             # FastAPI (or equivalent) over ui/workspace_model.py
│                                #   derive / transform / plan  — no filesystem
│                                #   local resource            — library, import, export
web/                             # Next.js app; forms rendered from spec/ metadata
```

**Validation dependency principle:** Basic read/write/round-trip functionality must work
with the repository alone. Use `assb_analyzer.io.pne_converter.parse_sch_cycle_map_bytes`
as an optional cross-validator; the absence of the external package must not cause basic
tests to be skipped.

---

## 8. Risks & Unresolved Items

| Item | Status | Response |
|------|--------|----------|
| Package import fails after editable install | **Resolved** | Regression validation of editable install and clean-target wheel import |
| Parser/schema/compiler end-condition offset discrepancy | **Internally consistent** | `fEndV=28`, `fEndI=32`, `fEndC=36`; comparison of originals with nonzero `fEndC` against the external parser continues in B2 |
| Misunderstanding of LOOP goto/count offsets | **Resolved** | Corpus confirmed `+48/+52`; corrected the previous `+84/+88` and added 612/696 golden tests |
| Mismatch between lab format and writer target | **Mitigated** | C6 framing for `0x10004/696`; full 696 schedule semantic parity not claimed |
| Automatic selection of 612 vs 696 byte step size | Partially understood | Validate version→size mapping against the 102 secured measured sch files |
| PNE raw current unit (mA vs A) | Depends on ini range | Compare Cell range profile with ASSB `unit_scale` |
| PNE voltage/L-level encoding | **Partially resolved (612)** | Ensol map: `+12` mV (not `+16`); L-level fVref heuristic only for 15–80 V range; QPEED still needs pair |
| Dual capacity models | **Writer path resolved** | Writer uses explicit `cell_capacity_mAh` (= 1C mA); viewer may still infer Q_nom |
| Internal structure of `FILE_GRADE`, `STRUCT_EIS_SET` | Only names are present in Excel | Defer 0x00010007 to Phase 4 |
| Recommended Δt/ΔV/ΔQ values | UNKNOWN in cyclediag | Reverse-extract from internal standard sch samples |
| Writer validation on physical equipment | **Closed — C5** | PNE02 2026-09-08; checklist signed |
| External ASSB parser availability | Dependency outside the repository | Make the internal parser the default source of truth and optionally cross-validate |
| Drift between fixture names and test expectations | **Confirmed** | Do not hide with skips; stabilize with manifest-based fixture lookup |
| Experimental output mistaken for production | **Mitigated, not resolved** | Default-block `build`; require manifest, reopen verification, and exact-hash release gates |
| Binary changes after parsed END ignored by diff | **Resolved** | Compare and report unparsed tails in addition to header and step records |
| Equipment profile inferred from filenames | **Prohibited** | Require explicit provenance/profile metadata and retain unknown when unavailable |
| Controlled-pair metadata is incomplete or inconsistent | Open | Add schema validation before evidence promotion (B5) |
| Resume renumbers steps without proven goto remapping | **Resolved (2026-09-06)** | `resume/splice.py::_remap_loop_goto_targets` now rewrites LOOP goto (@48 + Ensol mirror @564) to the post-splice numbering, and raises before writing if the original target falls before the resume point (unrepresentable). `io/sch_binary.patch_loop_goto` added; covered by `tests/test_resume.py::test_resume_remaps_loop_goto_target_within_resumed_range` / `test_resume_blocks_when_loop_target_would_be_dropped` |
| Documentation language/status drift | Partially resolved | README and user guide are English; audit remaining public docs and derive test status in CI |

## 9. Current focus (active gate)

**Active: Gate F — operational release.** Gate G completed 2026-09-09; Gate E is closed
except E2.2, which waits on the lab.

The desktop workspace shipped 2026-09-09 and Gate E is substantially closed, but the UI is
being re-platformed to Next.js, so no further work goes into the Tk or Qt shells. What is
left of E2.3/E4 — a way to save a method, a serializer so an import session's plan can reach
`patch-sch` — is G0, because those live in the model and carry over.

Everything that would make the tool *usable for real experiments* is now blocked on people,
not code: pattern acceptance needs a CTSEditorPro batch reopen (PV4), and F1–F4 need the
matching records.

| Step | Gate | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | C5 | ✅ Passed — `GATE_C_EQUIPMENT_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md` |
| 2 | C exit | ✅ Gaps: DCR IR-only; 696 tail unused; CLI header 54-byte region |
| 3 | D | ✅ Software P0/P1 complete; see §6.5 honest gaps |
| 4 | **E foundation** | E0/E0.5: IA + composer END/LOOP + catalog + validator |
| 5 | **Pattern PV0–PV3** | Canonical HPPC/QPEED/QC/Cycle recipes + reopen candidate pack |
| 6 | **E workspace** | ✅ Shipped 2026-09-09 (Qt/QML default, Tk fallback) |
| 7 | **User PV4** | ⏳ Batch CTSPro reopen + save-as files; run은 별도 PV6 |
| 8 | **G0** | Stateless path + `SchPatchPlan.to_dict()` + method save — closes E2.3/E4 |
| 9 | **G1–G5** | Web API → Next.js screens → local-resource API → retire desktop shells |
| 10 | F | Exact pattern hash/profile 범위로 release (G와 병렬) |

Completed: Gate A; Gate B (`gate_b_passed`); Gate C (C5 signed); Gate D (software).

Process: use §5.6 lessons checklist on every future gate claim.

## 11. Discovered issues backlog

New problems found during implementation are recorded here first, then promoted into the
relevant Gate task table (§6.2–6.7). Closed items stay for audit trail.

| Date | Gate | Severity | Issue | Status | Resolution / next action |
|------|------|----------|-------|--------|--------------------------|
| 2026-09-13 | E1 | low | Four `cursor/*` PRs sat open two weeks, 54–62 commits behind. #6 and #8 are genuinely superseded (duration/theming ported in `e5eee75`; QPEED/HPPC live in Gate D-verified modules; the flow_editor rework died with G4). #12 and #7 were **not** — both landed on master instead. | ✅ resolved | #12 cherry-picked (`2c39f09`); #7's `explain_schedule` ported. **#6 and #8 still need closing on GitHub — no API token is available here.** |
| 2026-09-11 | B / E4 | **high** | **0x10005/720 writer promotion contradicts itself.** Commit 24ad984 asserts in `test_writer_ready_allowlist_matches_gate_b_controlled_pairs` that 720 carries all seven writer keys, while the same commit's `schema/fields.py` entry says "Not writer-ready", its ratings note says "Writer keys stay unverified on the new units", and `GATE_B_VALIDATION_REPORT.json` never mentions 720 — 696 got a recorded B1 prefix diff, 720 did not. Demonstrated on a real PNE15 file: the import session offers 7 editable fields citing PNE02/612 evidence and accepts a patch. | 🔎 open — **user decision** | Either run a 612↔720 B1 diff (or a CTSPro reopen on a 6A unit) and record it, or drop 0x10005 from `WRITER_VERIFIED_VERSIONS` and the test. Behaviour is unchanged until then; the policy is now one editable set in `schema/fields.py`. |
| 2026-08-31 | B | blocking | PNE voltage/L-level encoding (`+12` mode vs `+16` fVref) | **resolved for writer path** | Ensol map + Gate B pairs: `@12` volt/vlim, `@16` current_mA |
| 2026-08-31 | B | blocking | Dual capacity models (CellProfile vs stack-inferred Q_nom) | resolved | Writer uses explicit `CellProfile.nominal_capacity_mAh`; inferred Q_nom is display-only |
| 2026-08-31 | B | normal | Controlled-pair metadata incomplete → evidence promotion unsafe | resolved | B5 intake validation + PNE02 pairs; PNE16 waived |
| 2026-09-03 | C | **blocking** | C5 equipment smoke still required before executable builds | **resolved 2026-09-08** | PNE02 passed `smoke_writer_probe.sch`; see checklist |
| 2026-09-03 | C | normal | C6 original “696 semantic lab parity” stronger than delivered | **accepted waiver** | Reframed: framing + zero-tail corpus policy; see §6.4 honest assessment |
| 2026-09-03 | C | normal | C4 ASSB cross-check is thin (layout/steps/`fEndC`) | accepted | Enough as smoke; deepen only if C5 or lab diffs demand it |
| 2026-09-03 | C | normal | 696-byte tail (612–695) all-zero in secured corpus | resolved | Writer zero-pad matches corpus; `SCH_696_TAIL_ANALYSIS.md` |
| 2026-09-03 | C | normal | DCR binary offsets unresolved | accepted deferral | IR-only until controlled evidence; blocks DC-IR fidelity (Gate D), not C5 |
| 2026-08-31 | E | safety | Resume may renumber steps without goto remap proof | **resolved (2026-09-06)** | LOOP goto now remapped to post-splice numbering, or resume is blocked with a clear error when the original target would be dropped; see §8 row and `resume/splice.py` |
| 2026-09-01 | B | low | README test badge lags actual count | resolved | Badge synced to 252 passed (2026-09-06) |
| 2026-09-06 | A | normal | `tools/analyze_schedule_mdb.py` imported `access_parser` unconditionally at module scope, so its absence aborted **all** test collection (not just the skipped MDB test), contradicting the "local pytest green" claim | resolved | Import made lazy (`TYPE_CHECKING` + in-function import); `access_parser` registered as the `mdb` optional extra in `pyproject.toml` |
| 2026-08-31 | C | normal | 89/93 lab fixtures use `0x10004/696`, not 612-byte layout | mitigated | C6 framing writer exists; full schedule parity deferred |
| 2026-09-01 | B | normal | fEndV unit mismatch (fixture mV vs compiler V) | resolved | Ensol adoption; `tests/test_unit_contract.py` |
| 2026-09-01 | B/D | normal | Golden fixtures locked from user intake (7 selected, PNE02+PNE16) | done | `planning/GOLDEN_FIXTURES_LOCKED.json` |
| 2026-09-03 | E | normal | UX intent clarified: Nova + LabVIEW *feel* for modular schedule authoring (not live Autolab control) | accepted | §1.1 rewritten; Gate E retitled; E8 removed as false target |
| 2026-09-06 | C | normal | C5 required a physical reopen per field/module shape; most of that risk was already closed by existing PNE02 pairs and corpus mining but never consolidated | resolved | [`GATE_C5_EVIDENCE_COVERAGE.md`](../legacy/planning/GATE_C5_EVIDENCE_COVERAGE.md) audits every step field; `smoke_writer_probe` module/fixture combines charge+discharge+LOOP+per-step sampling into one from-scratch build so a single reopen replaces several |
| 2026-09-06 | C | normal | `build_sch_header()` (CLI `build` path) leaves 54/1760 header bytes at zero where a real lab-authored header has non-zero content (concentrated ~0x2D8-0x361, past `HOFF_NAME`'s window — plausibly the second `FILE_TEST_INFORMATION` name/description block from §2.3) | open, no action needed yet | Not packed — no controlled-pair/corpus evidence for their meaning (L3). `tools/rebuild_smoke_sch_from_lab_header.py` sidesteps this by cloning a real header instead of using `build_sch_header()`; a clean C5 on `smoke_writer_probe.sch` does **not** clear this for the plain CLI `build` path specifically. Revisit only if `build_sch_header()`'s output needs to go to equipment directly |
| 2026-09-06 | D | normal | `dcir`/`hppc`/`rpt`/`qpeed` modules SOC-target via `end_capacity_fraction`, which packs `fEndC`@36 -- a field `schema/fields.py` marks `semantic_unverified` with **no nonzero example in the corpus** (weaker evidence than DCR, which at least gets a warning). `compile_step_warnings()` already warns for DCR and `goto_step_id` but silently skipped this one | resolved | Added the missing warning in `engine/compiler.py::compile_step_warnings`; also fixed `io/writer.py::write_sch` discarding `compile_step_warnings()`'s result (`_ = ...`) instead of returning it, so the CLI `build` path had **zero** visibility into any of these warnings even though the compiler always computed them. `build` now prints `WARN:` lines and the manifest's `warnings` include them |
| 2026-09-06 | D | normal | `modules/insitu_cycle.py::expand()` checked `steps[0].label is None` to decide whether to relabel the inherited cycle marker, but `StepIntent.label` defaults to `""` (never `None`) and `CycleLifeModule` always sets a real label -- the condition could never be true, so in-situ projects always kept the generic "cycle marker" label instead of "in-situ cycle marker (no RPT)" | resolved | Condition changed to `steps[0].step_type == "cycle"`; `tests/test_insitu_cycle.py` added |
| 2026-09-06 | E | normal | `edit/bulk_edit.py::coerce_param_for_field` compared a dataclass field's `.type` against the real `int`/`float`/`str`/`bool` type objects, but every module uses `from __future__ import annotations`, which makes `.type` the annotation **string** (e.g. `"int"`) -- the comparison never matched, so `target_type` was always `None` and coercion fell back to guessing from string content alone. Concretely, bulk-editing an `int` field with a negative value (e.g. `loop_count=-5`) silently stored the **float** `-5.0` instead of the int `-5` (`"-5".isdigit()` is `False`) | resolved | Resolve by annotation name via a small `int`/`float`/`str`/`bool` lookup instead of identity comparison; `tests/test_bulk_edit.py::test_coerce_param_for_field_keeps_int_fields_as_int` added |
| 2026-09-06 | B | **blocking (evidence integrity)** | `validate/intake.py::validate_intake_with_compare_report` recorded an `expected_field` vs. actual-changed-field mismatch as a **warning**, not an error. `IntakeValidationResult.valid = not errors` ignores warnings, so `tools/run_gate_b_validation.py`'s `_controlled_pair_evidence()` (`pair_clean = combined.valid`) could mark a pair `evidence_complete` and register the **wrong** offset under `covered[equipment]` even when the observed byte change landed on a different field entirely -- defeating the controlled-pair evidence tier the whole B5 gate exists to enforce | resolved | Changed to `errors.append(...)`; re-ran `run_gate_b_validation` and confirmed `gate_b_passed=true` still holds (all 9 real PNE02 pairs already had a correctly-matching `expected_field`, so nothing was actually promoted on bad evidence -- this closes the loophole for future pairs). `tests/test_validation_intake.py::test_intake_with_compare_report_rejects_wrong_expected_field` added |
| 2026-09-06 | analysis | normal | `stack/levels.py::_L_EXPLICIT` regex (`L[\s._-]*(\d...)`) had no token boundary before `L`, so it matched an `L`/`l` preceded by *any* other letter -- e.g. "Cell01" → spurious `l0`, "Model3350" → spurious `l3`. Confirmed on the real 102-file corpus: `set3_bimodal-30_45도 0.5C cycle.sch` and `bimodal_0.5C cycle.sch` both got a wrong filename-based L-level guess from the trailing "l" in "bimodal". It could also let a false match earlier in the name shadow a real explicit L-level later in the same name (`re.search` returns the leftmost match) | resolved | Added a negative lookbehind (`(?<![A-Za-z])L...`) requiring the character before `L` not be a letter. Viewer/analysis-only per L7 (writer path never uses filename inference), so this never affected binary output -- only the viewer's displayed L-level/C-rate guess. `tests/test_stack_levels.py` parametrized regression tests added |
| 2026-09-06 | F | **resolved (process integrity)** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` had existed and been active since 2026-09-02 (commit `be373a8`), but ROADMAP.md §6.1/§6.7 claimed hosted CI was "not started" -- meanwhile the workflow had actually been **failing for 12 consecutive commits** (`0aa9b6f` through `64dddd8`, all of Gate C's work) on the `access_parser` collection bug. Neither the failure nor the workflow's existence was ever reflected in ROADMAP.md | resolved | Fix pushed as commit `d60ea3b`; [run #33](https://github.com/Hwiho/pne_scheduler/actions/runs/34037824999) completed **success** (Ruff, Pytest, corpus-smoke all green) -- hosted CI restored after 12 consecutive red runs. Remaining optional follow-up: replace the static hand-set shields.io test badge in README with a real Actions status badge so silent red CI can't recur unnoticed (not done yet, low priority) |
| 2026-09-06 | E | normal | 6 unmerged `cursor/*` remote branches discovered (abandoned Cursor Cloud agent runs, diverged up to 53 commits from master) | open — needs human review | 3 touch UI (`cursor/update-roadmap-5ac9` theming/wiring, `cursor/module-recipes-presets-5ac9` recipe editing, `cursor/explain-schedules-5ac9` schedule explanation) — patterns extracted to `UI_UX_NOTES.md`, too stale to merge wholesale. 3 touch Gate B/C validation tooling (`cursor/create-gate-b-baseline-dfb2`, `cursor/gate-c-safety-manifest-eccb`, `cursor/mine-internal-dataset-dfb2`) — not reviewed in depth, may contain unmerged evidence/tooling work worth checking before deleting the branches |
| 2026-09-08 | C | **blocking→fixing** | CTS “공통 안전조건 용량” offset mis-mapped; PNE16 vs PNE02 UI units/slots differ | **resolved** | Cap at `0x3D8+12` / `0x458+12`; PNE02 C5 showed **800 mAh** |
| 2026-09-08 | D | normal | OCV/Impedance/Pattern/Balance have CTS UI types but **zero** corpus samples | open (stubs) | Type codes in `SCH_STEP_TYPES`; shared prefix packing + warnings; [`STEP_TYPES_EXTENDED.md`](STEP_TYPES_EXTENDED.md) — need lab controlled pairs |
| 2026-09-08 | D | normal | Gate D module expands are templates, not full lab schedule clones | accepted | Family topology tests + harness E2E; byte-faithful module cloning deferred |
| 2026-09-08 | D | **blocking (verification integrity)** | Gate D mutation backtest: `_check_v6_families()` read only the static golden fixture and never the module's expansion, so every `family_*` check passed even when modules were broken to emit a single `rest` step. The method doc claimed the module comparison the code never did (L4) | resolved | V6 now compares required families against **both** golden and live module expansion (`module_ref` rows in `GATE_D_FAMILY_CHECKS`); `tests/test_gate_d_verification_sensitivity.py` pins the sensitivity |
| 2026-09-08 | D | **blocking (verification integrity)** | `gate_d_passed` was `all(status != "fail")`, so skips did not block it — deleting every golden fixture still produced `gate_d_passed=true` with **zero** golden comparisons executed (L4) | resolved | Skips now block the exit claim and V8 names the checks that never ran; report still distinguishes skip from mismatch |
| 2026-09-08 | C | normal | Header safety-block layout is PNE02-specific (capacity `0x3D8+12`/`0x458+12`; PNE16 reads `+16` as 최소 전류) but `build_sch_header()` takes no unit and the build manifest recorded `equipment: null` — the conflict lived only in source comments (L1: document conflicts, don't silently pick one) | resolved | `SAFETY_BLOCK_CONVENTION` exported from `io/header.py`; build manifest now records `target_profile.safety_block_convention` and carries the PNE02-only caveat in `warnings`. No PNE16 offsets invented (L3) |
| 2026-09-08 | D/PV1 | normal→pattern-blocking | C5에서 `dod_percent`@384(프로브 40%)가 **CTSEditorPro UI에 표시되지 않음**("확인 못함"). 현재 HPPC full/QPEED는 이 DOD 경로를, dcir/hppc:legacy/rpt는 별도 `fEndC`@36 경로를 사용하므로 한 번의 확인으로 두 의미를 함께 승인할 수 없음 | open, timing assigned | Pattern acceptance 첫 lab checkpoint에서 두 value-only controlled pair 수행: **A)** DOD/SOC percent `30→40%`로 @384 확인, **B)** capacity cutoff `24→32 mAh`(80 mAh 기준; 또는 UI percent 30→40)로 `fEndC`@36과 단위 확인. off/on은 enable/cap-ref flag용 보조 pair. 그 전까지 각각 `corpus_inferred`/`semantic_unverified`, 관련 SOC-dependent pattern의 reopen 승격 금지. [`PATTERN_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](PATTERN_VALIDATION_PLAN.md) §4 |
| 2026-09-08 | E | high | 모듈 합성 계약 부재: 일부 모듈이 자체 END를 내보내고 LOOP target을 모듈-local raw 번호로 저장해, 여러 모듈 연결 시 non-final END나 잘못된 goto가 생길 수 있음. `qpeed:soc_setting` LOOP는 target/count도 없음 | resolved 2026-09-09 | Composer가 단일 최종 END 소유; fragment-local reference와 legacy local target을 절대 step으로 resolve; invalid LOOP 차단; 다중 loop-module 회귀 추가. [`GATE_E_PLAN.md`](GATE_E_PLAN.md) §3.1/§5 |
| 2026-09-08 | D/E | high | Gate D family-level green과 실제 protocol-pattern 충실도가 분리되지 않음: QPEED full은 짧은 HPPC 상속 구현이었고 golden은 167 step, HPPC golden은 62 step, QC module은 없었음 | partial 2026-09-09 | HPPC 62-step, QPEED 167/11-step 및 QC 3종 구현, trust catalog/preflight와 10-pattern reopen pack 생성 완료. 기존 family-template exact recipe와 PV1/PV4는 open.

## 2026-09-18 Review — 정확성 및 기능 확장

기존 Gate·controlled-pair·장비별 이력은 그대로 유지한다. 현재 리뷰의 구현 상태와 이후 우선순위는 [정확성 리뷰 및 실행 로드맵](../docs/CORRECTNESS_REVIEW_2026-09.md)을 함께 읽는다.

- **구현됨:** resume/checkpoint/splice, template 출력·협력 lock·예외 복구, API local/cloud 정책 및 frontend 변경 queue의 회귀 방어. 새 CI matrix의 원격 통과는 별도 확인 대상이다.
- **실험적:** 장비 실행 미승인 출력. `equipment_executable=false`, LOOP 수동 검토 및 CTS/장비 검증은 유지한다.
- **계획:** typed DSL/schema migration → graph/timeline·semantic diff/승인 → resume dry-run/replay·target capability → DOE/채널 simulation → CycleDiag manifest 피드백 → tenant-isolated cloud jobs. 단계별 의존성·산출물·인수 기준은 연결 문서에서 관리한다.
- 과거 Gate 완료는 특정 증거 범위에 한정되며 범용 장비 승인이나 다중 tenant 보안 인증으로 확대 해석하지 않는다.
